# StatComp21015
StatComp21015 is a simple R package developed to implement two functions which is related to the simulations of the perceived adjacency matrices when we address community detection problems based on the partial network information. 
Two functions are considered, namely, qua95 (calculating the 0.95 quantile of a new statistic) and subg (generateing the perceived adjacency matrix based on one individual).
